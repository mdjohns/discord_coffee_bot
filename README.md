# Discord Coffee Bot

### About

One of my best friends roasts coffee as a hobby for our friend group. He keeps his available stock in a Google spreadsheet, and I thought
it would be fun to get that information on demand in our Discord server.

### Dependencies

- [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
- [Google-Spreadsheet](https://github.com/theoephraim/node-google-spreadsheet)

### Functionality

The bot is pretty simple.

There are three commands:

1. `!help` displays all supported commands
2. `!link` shares the link to the full spreadsheet.
3. `!menu` uses Google-Spreadsheet to query spreadsheet data, format data, and display as [Discord Embed(s)](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/embeds.html)


### Demo

**Note**: Please excuse the size of the gif, there was a lot of coffee on hand so I had to make the gif extra long :sweat_smile:
